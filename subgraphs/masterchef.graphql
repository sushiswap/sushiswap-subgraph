  # We do some fancy math here. Basically, any point in time, the amount of SUSHIs
  # entitled to a user but is pending to be distributed is:
  # pending reward = (user.amount * pool.accSushiPerShare) - user.rewardDebt
  # Whenever a user deposits or withdraws LP tokens to a pool. Here's what happens:
  # 1. The pool's `accSushiPerShare` (and `lastRewardBlock`) gets updated.
  # 2. User receives the pending reward sent to his/her address.
  # 3. User's `amount` gets updated.
  # 4. User's `rewardDebt` gets updated.
